## Abstract:
The *Old Kingdom musical ensemble scenes database* is a digital and relational
database, which was developed in order to fulfil the aims and facilitate the research of
a Master of Research thesis submitted in December 2020. The database includes
geographical, iconographical and textual data, which is derived from a total of
101 'musical ensemble scenes' from the Old Kingdom with a particular focus on
the hand and arm gestures represented by the ensemble member referred to as
'singer-chironomist'. This project sought to establish a typology of gestures,
the results of which can be found in the accompanying thesis '*"One sings for you
with the hand": gestures represented in Old Kingdom musical ensemble scenes*'.
Though the aims of this thesis were focused on the gestures of the 'singer-chironomist',
the database was designed with the foresight to facilitate future research into
all facets of this scene type, as well as to provide insight towards music
in ancient Egypt and neighbouring civilisations more generally. It is hoped that
this database will be used by researchers and updated as our knowledge and dataset
expands.


## Period
Old Kingdom Egypt (c. 2686-2181 BC)


## Keywords
* Egypt,
* Egyptology,
* iconography,
* music archaeology.
* musicology,
* archaeology,
* chironomy/cheironomy

## Potential Applications of the Data
The *Old Kingdom musical ensemble scenes database* may be used by those wishing
to investigate the iconographical, textual, and archaeo-musicological elements
represented in this scene type from the period of the Old Kingdom. However, the database was designed
with the foresight and hope that it would facilitate future research into music
scenes across ancient Egypt's long and rich history. An expansion to the database,
either by way of incorporating additional detail to the existing scenes or by
way of adding similar scenes from later periods, is the ultimate goal.

## Methodological Notes
The *Old Kingdom musical ensemble scenes database* references and correlates
with a 'scene type' defined in the *Oxford Expedition to Egypt: Scene-details Database*
(see **Related Publications** above), namely *12.3 Musician(s), with or without singers*
(see here: https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/oee_ahrc_2006/queryThemes.cfm?section=tombs&theme=12.3&CFID=aa6cc367-de02-48ba-a1b8-c016024517a6&CFTOKEN=0). The *Oxford Expedition to Egypt: Scene-details Database*
is an Archaeology Data Service (ADS) ColdFusion (CFML) database.

Geographical data was from Pleiades (https://pleiades.stoa.org/) and Google Maps
(https://www.google.com/maps).

philological considerations employed), see Chapter 3 of *Megier, A. (2020)*
