## Abstract:
The *Old Kingdom musical ensemble scenes database* is a digital and relational
database, which was developed in order to fulfil the aims and facilitate the research of
a Master of Research thesis submitted in December 2020. The database includes
geographical, iconographical and textual data, which is derived from a total of
101 'musical ensemble scenes' from the Old Kingdom with a particular focus on
the hand and arm gestures represented by the ensemble member referred to as
'singer-chironomist'. This project sought to establish a typology of gestures,
the results of which can be found in the accompanying thesis '*"One sings for you
with the hand": gestures represented in Old Kingdom musical ensemble scenes*'.
Though the aims of this thesis were focused on the gestures of the 'singer-chironomist',
the database was designed with the foresight to facilitate future research into
all facets of this scene type, as well as to provide insight towards music
in ancient Egypt and neighbouring civilisations more generally. It is hoped that
this database will be used by researchers and updated as our knowledge and dataset
expands.
